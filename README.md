This was an attempt to make the lids compatible with the existing database. I decided against that.

Go check out the head at [watgbridge](codeberg.com/https://codeberg.org/coco_code_github_forks/watgbridge) and I'll have a new database with the lids working (hopefully).

I'm leaving this branch here just for archive purposes. it will be removed from codeberg
